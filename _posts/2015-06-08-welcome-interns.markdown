Hi! Welcome to Praekelt Foundation

This site has been created to

- help explain to you how Praekelt Foundation operates 
- what tools we use and why we use them 
- how you can set up your machine correctly

You will be working with various people while at Praekelt, so feel free to ask them questions about the above, but before you do, refer back to this site and linked sites. If you feel that there is missing information, mistakes have been made or you want to contribute to this site with your experiences and additional information, [contact me][contact] or [create an issue here][issue].

We do already have documentation [here](http://ways-of-working.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) which lists our ways of working, but it is quite technical in nature. This site and its articles aims to give a simple, introductory and more linear representation of our methods.
