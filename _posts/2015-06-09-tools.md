This article is going to briefly cover some of the tools you'll need to work here and then go into some of the specific tools that we use. If you run into any trouble installing any of the necessarry tools, 

###Get familiar with a text editor

There's a ton of debate about what's better for a development environment in terms of text editors and IDEs. At Praekelt, almost everyone uses [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). There's also a similar text editor called [Atom](https://atom.io/) which is free, although Sublime Text will give you an unlimited free trial if you're happy clicking 'ignore' on sporadic pop ups asking you for cash. A text editor is preferred because it gives you more flexibility with regards to editing various types of files and Sublime Text and Atom have some great add-ons (packages) that provide you with added functionality. Having said that, if you have an IDE that works for you, great :) As long as you're using a tool that you're comfortable with and enables you to get the job done, we don't mind.

###pep8 Linter

There are a bunch of options out there, but make sure you get some kind of add on to check that your code adheres to [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

###Homebrew

For those of you with macs, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Those of you with Ubuntu will already have this functionality with the `apt-get` command. This will make it much easier and faster for you to install software. Instead of downloading a file, unzipping it and manually running an install, this can all be taken care of from the command line. e.g:

{% highlight bash %}

brew install node

{% endhighlight %}

or for the Ubuntu crowd:

{% highlight bash %}

apt-get install node

{% endhighlight %}

###Gitflow and hub

You must install gitflow and hub, in order to adhere to our ways of working process.

For Mac:
{% highlight bash %}

$ brew install git-flow
$ brew install hub

{% endhighlight %}

For Ubuntu:
{% highlight bash %}

$ apt-get install git-flow
$ apt-get install hub

{% endhighlight %}

###Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) (now called Elastic) is an integral part of our stack. If you run local versions of our Unicore sites, you will need a local elasticsearch server running.

For Mac:
{% highlight bash %}

$ brew install elasticsearch

{% endhighlight %}

For Ubuntu:
{% highlight bash %}

$ apt-get install elasticsearch

{% endhighlight %}

###Virtualenv

You must install virtualenv. Basically, virtualenv allows you to have different versions of software and packages on your machine at the same time. I have written a more in-depth article on what is does and how to use it [here](). You should have python installed on your machine, which has pip bundled with it. Pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. 

Firstly, install virtualenv:

{% highlight bash %}

$ pip install virtualenv

{% endhighlight %}

###iTerm and Oh-my-zsh



###Skitch

[Skitch](https://evernote.com/skitch/) is just a helpful image tool, especially for front-end work, for capturing screenshots, adding annotations and sharing with Slack. (Mac Only)
