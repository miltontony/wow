You should have your own laptop, if you don't let us know ASAP and we'll see if we can sort something out. 

We're all about Unix-based machines, so if you have a Windows machine and its your prefered OS then I'm afraid you're going to have to do a bit of adjusting. You will either have to do a full install of a linux OS (your best bet is [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)) or partition your drive. There are way too many variations on how to do either of these things to cover here, but if you're struggling, feel free to ask some of the folks in the office who use Ubuntu. Those with MacBooks will be too busy enjoying a fully functioning machine to help. Information in the rest of these articles will expect that you are using Linux or OSX.
