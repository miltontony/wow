#Git and the basics

Git is going to be a huge part of how you use and write software here. Lots of articles have already been written about git so we're not going to repeat what's already been said:

If you're unsure about git, or need a refresher, check out [this article](http://alistapart.com/article/get-started-with-git) to get the basics right.

Familiarise yourself with the syntax of git, because we will expect you to be able to do this in the terminal, even if you prefer a GUI. However, there are some helpful tools that make working with git easier. I use [GitX](http://gitx.frim.nl/), a simple GUI for OSX, to see the changes that I have made before committing. There are also tools for terminal like [om-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) which provide helpful information about git repositories in the command line (for Linux and OSX).

I speak from experience when I say that git is not always the easiest thing to get right and I've managed to bugger things up a fair amount. If in doubt, ask someone!
